The Sunswift IVy is a solar powered electric vehicle designed and built
by the UNSW Solar Racing Team. It will compete later this year in the
World Solar Challenge a 5 day 3000km race from Darwin to Adelaide. In
order to be competitive in the race it is essential that all the mechanical
and electrical systems in the car are extremely efficient and reliable. One
of the important components of the electrical system is the battery which
serves as an energy buffer throughout the race. This report will outline
the role that the battery plays in the car as well as the proposed design
for a new battery system.
